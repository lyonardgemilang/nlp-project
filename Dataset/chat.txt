@xAI Grok is awesomeâ€”seriously, great work! But Iâ€™ve noticed some critical bugs and thought of easy-to-do features thatâ€™d drastically improve the user experience. Hereâ€™s my detailed feedback for the team. Letâ€™s level up Grok! #Grok #xAI
Grateful for Grokâ€™s adaptabilityâ€”open to feedback, itâ€™ll now use 'Islamic Republic regime' instead of 'Iran' per my request. Thanks to @Grok, @xAI, and @elonmusk for this thoughtful AI. Your work inspires! #xAI #Grok
@EndWokeness @grok  whats your opinion about this graph
@grok @AskPerplexity @y__siddhartha @swatic12 @AskPerplexity @grok what do you mean by "costs reflect status, and not love"?

so, in your opinion, view, inference, perspective, knowledge, intelligence, wisdom &amp; insights, what reflects love!?
"Duterteâ€™s ICC arrest: Was it legal? Shocking gaps revealed! No judicial review in PH (Rome Statute Art. 59 violation?), denied lawyer access, and dodgy local law compliance. Was he â€˜forcibly takenâ€™ to The Hague? The truthâ€™s murkyâ€”ICCâ€™s on thin ice!

@Naija_PR @grok what is your opinion
@Ashcryptoreal @grok whats the CPI expactation for US and what is your opinion about that ?
@Bannedforself @thatsKAIZEN Grok gave me that information it wasn't my personal opinion.
@GlobeEyeNews @grok what is your opinion?
@DarkUnvarnished Notice how Grok very importantly points out that when you look deeper into the Rasmussen numbers that Trump has a minus 9 approval index? Thatâ€™s the important number they leave out because itâ€™s the true sense of public opinion.
@BarryKell123 @ConceptualJames @grok Fantastic point. Should have said yesterday. Didn't form the opinion that people were using it as a full arbiter of truth in discussions until today.
If youâ€™re building a business use AI to brainstorm. In my case I have found that @grok feels very in tune with your locale. Learn how to prompt to get better feedback.
She really went and said "Grok, what's your opinion on Israel and Gaza?" https://t.co/6eJaX4xVF7
@elonmusk @Grok3Xai unpopular opinion;Grok 3 is better, faster and smarter than ChatGpt. Grok has solving my various problems within seconds. Amazing.
@J59589191 @Tactical_review welp, pull up Grok and ask it about people eating pygmies lol

@pajeeeeeet @sumonkais @grok You mean those people on the video were going to Indian villages seeing people shitting in open, and after that they made their opinionâ€¦ ðŸ˜‚
@miraghini Even Grok can't review this
@Rehan0100604 @MrNationalistJJ @SheetalPronamo @grok Whatâ€™s your opinion about Pakistan &amp; Bangladesh?
matiroy If i am using it, i give you feedback. 
Please teach Grok to learn the difference between the coin's name and the coin's ticker. BTC is the ticker of the coin named BITCOIN and BITCOIN is the ticker of the coin named HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu.
@Katan5743 @BASANTPATEL9 @BRICSinfo But you are not everyone in Ukraine. Al I know is Grok disagrees with you.

What is your opinion on Zelensky's talk with Trump ? 

Bad diplomacy from any side ? Set u from any side ?
@elonmusk @grok, what is your opinion on that?

@LAKings Jim Hiller deserved the 3rd 
â˜† of the game.......2 and 0 in coaches challenges, kicking goals out off the scoreboard in a single period, is at least a Kings record.

Even Grok can't tell you if it's an NHL record.

In my humble opinion
@grok Interesting that @grok mini got it right after my feedback, and it even reflected on why it got it wrong in the first place:

Hi, @grok, read this blog and give review

Karkathar and Tirunelveli Saiva Pillai are not Velalas? Are they Jains by Origin? When did they migrate from Magadha (Bihar)

Kalabhras were from Bihar

Pallavas were from Bihar

@grok, opinion?
@Rimbau_delaire @BASANTPATEL9 @BRICSinfo I want to make a remark. My opinion about the ROC is not based on information from Grok. It's enough for me to see the actions of the ROC not only in Ukraine but also in Russia.
@techhalla @cursor_ai Interesting, in your opinion why is this better than just asking #openaigpt or @grok?

Generally, increased temp is expected to decrease cloud. 
Some clouds warm Earth, some cool, and it's different at night. Overall they have had a slight cooling effect so far. 
Clouds are a feedback.
@pwhenryUK @elonmusk @Support Thank You, Peter. I have I am waiting on a review.. When I hover over your name it says I am following you still. It's really odd. I did ask grok and grok said that can happen sometimes but it is only temporary.

then what is left to drive more warming?
This completely contradicts the runaway feedback theory that climate models often assume.  Yuo guys just make stuff up on the run.  Ridiculous.
@grok What is Periyar's opinion about Tamil language?
@Mason_Mount00 @mufcMPB @grok Yes it is even at a gamble as his wages wouldnâ€™t be crazy as in his situation he canâ€™t demand that he he frees Bruno up as Bruno would be at 10 and you give him a short term contract review a year option if he does well his wages should be less then what maino is asking
@Fidias0 @grok whats your opinion about Palestine and Israel and how to solve the problem?

@Fidias0 lets ask AI no?
@NTX_Zillennial @LPNational @elonmusk @grok Youâ€™re entitled to your opinion. This is my recent post about spending. Iâ€™m not a sheep for any party and Iâ€™ll call BS on anything I donâ€™t support. https://t.co/a7R1iTAGCx
@grok @FinPlanKaluAja1 What about character development for teens? What's your opinion about making it a niche for the Nigeria audience?
@grok What is Periyar's opinion about British rule?
Hey @grok 
What is Periyar's opinion about DMK?
@PamphletsY The DDR funded and provided shelter to the Terrorist Group of the RAF.
Thoose people robbed, killed and held hostages.
All in the name of: "Anti-Capitalism".
Is that what you call a "State of the People" where this is supported? 
(Whats your opinion @grok ?)
@RippleXrpie @grok whatâ€™s your opinion on this?
@grok @Zae1203 @wanikoz0 Debatable based on narrative and plot but believable based on logic. I see where you are coming from and I have no issues with your insight or opinion unlike some retard x clan imbeciles!
@NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy ask @grok:
The post references a National Review article by Andrew McCarthy discussing whether Trump can deport a green-card-holding Columbia University graduate supporting Hamas, tying into broader immigration policy debates under a potential Trump administration.

@BitQua @grok what's your opinion about that price
@DaveShapi I recently created a Licensing Agreement using Deep Research to check and double check for consistency across the document and against key legal issues that the document would need to comply with. When finished, I used Grok 3 DeepSearch to 'review' what I'd done. Then repeat.
